# tf2-fix-pack
here's my plan!!!
i visit gamebanana.com
i look at tf2 page
i download 30 duodecillion mods that fix the game one way or another
i pack them all into a vpk pack (open cmd, cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\bin; vpk.exe -M 0-TF2FixPack [name of the folder thing])
i put them all in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom
i profit (i don't need to have them all in folders or seperate vpk's which makes me take 20 minutes to join a server)
i lose like 2 gb of space
i continue to profit (i have 1 tb of space)
